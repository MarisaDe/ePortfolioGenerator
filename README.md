# ePortfolioGenerator

This project utilizes the JavaFX library. It allows the user to create their own web portfolio just by clicking around - no coding necessary.

Users can add:
+ Banner image
+ Images
+ Paragraph text
+ Header text
+ List elements
+ Video files
+ Slideshows
+ Infinite pages
+ Footers

Users can choose between:
+ 5 color schemes
+ 5 layout templates
+ 5 Google Font choices (which is customizable for each page)

When you save a file, it stores it in a JSON file. Javascript should then read the JSON file and generate HTML pages. This part has not been
implemented yet.

** The front end works correctly **
